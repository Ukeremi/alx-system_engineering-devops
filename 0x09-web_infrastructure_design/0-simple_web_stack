#### Documentation:

The above text-based diagram illustrates the one-server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com. Let's go through the components and their roles:

- **User's Computer:** Represents the user's device (e.g., laptop, smartphone) from which they access the website.

- **Web Browser:** The user's web browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, is used to request and view the web pages.

- **DNS Resolver:** Responsible for resolving the IP address associated with the domain name www.foobar.com.

- **Domain Name: foobar.com:** The domain name foobar.com, which serves as the address of the website.

- **DNS Record: www -> 8.8.8.8:** The DNS record that maps the subdomain www to the IP address 8.8.8.8, which is the address of our server.

- **Server: 8.8.8.8 (Your Server):** The single server that hosts the entire web infrastructure.

- **Web Server: Nginx:** Nginx is used as the web server to handle incoming HTTP requests and serve web pages.

- **Application Server:** The application server processes dynamic content and executes application-specific tasks.

- **Application Files (Code Base):** Contains the code for the website's functionality.

- **Database: MySQL:** MySQL is the database management system used to store and manage website data.

The communication flow is as follows:

1. The user enters www.foobar.com in their web browser.
2. The DNS resolver looks up the IP address of www.foobar.com using the DNS record.
3. The web browser establishes an HTTP connection with our server (8.8.8.8) to request the web page.
4. The web server (Nginx) receives the request and forwards it to the application server.
5. The application server processes the request, executes code from the application files, and interacts with the database (MySQL) if needed.

#### Issues with this Infrastructure:

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** Since we have only one server handling all components, it becomes a single point of failure. If the server goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

- **Downtime during Maintenance:** Performing maintenance tasks may require restarting the web server, causing downtime and making the website unavailable.

- **Scalability Challenges:** With a single server, the infrastructure may struggle to handle large incoming traffic efficiently. As the website grows in popularity, scaling may become challenging.
