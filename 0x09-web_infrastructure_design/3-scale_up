#### Documentation:

The above text-based diagram illustrates a scalable web infrastructure for www.foobar.com. In this design, we aim to handle increased traffic and ensure high availability by scaling the components.

- **User's Computer:** Represents the user's device (e.g., laptop, smartphone) from which they access the website.

- **Load Balancer (HAproxy):** The load balancer is configured as a cluster with redundancy to ensure high availability. It distributes incoming HTTP requests across the two web servers using a round-robin load balancing algorithm.

- **Server 1 and Server 2:** The two servers in the infrastructure that host the website. They work together in a cluster to handle incoming requests and distribute the load.

- **Firewall:** Each server is equipped with a firewall to enhance security by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.

- **Web Server (Nginx):** Nginx is used as the web server on both Server 1 and Server 2 to handle incoming HTTP requests and serve web pages.

- **Application Server:** The application server processes dynamic content, executes application-specific tasks, and communicates with the database.

- **Application Files (Code Base):** Contains the code for the website's functionality.

- **Database (MySQL):** MySQL is the database management system used to store and manage website data.

#### Explanation of Additional Elements:

- **Load Balancer Cluster:** We added a load balancer cluster to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers. This ensures that the workload is evenly distributed, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

- **Split Components with Their Own Server:** By having separate servers for each component (web server, application server, and database), we can scale each component independently based on its specific requirements. This allows us to allocate resources more efficiently and handle increased traffic effectively.
